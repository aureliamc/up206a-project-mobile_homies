# Mobile Homies Project Proposal 
- ### *Who:* Paola Tirado EscareÃ±o and Aurelia Mora
- ### *What:* How do Mobile Home Park (MHP) locations vary throughout LA County and what is the access to resources and opportunities within these communities?
  - More specifically, by focusing on the location of mobile home parks throughout Los Angeles County, we seek to identify how their location is an issue of equity by analyzing the racial and socioeconomic demographics of residents in mobile home parks, their proximity to pubilc transit lines, and their access to resources and opportunities. 
- ### *Where:* Greater LA County
  - Our project will be analyzing Mobile Home Parks (MHP) at the County level. Considering that there are few MHP in the City of Los Angeles, working at the County level allows us to have significantly higher observations to analyze. Using this [map](https://images.app.goo.gl/TFHKFsHWULFbxzD26) as a guide, we will be exploring locations in which there are existing public transit lines, to determine proximity and ability to access. We will also be analyzing supporting indicators at the census tract level. By using LA County census tract and neighborhood data, we aim to have a more centralized analysis of demographics, job opportunities, and social characteristics. 
- ### *Data Sources*: 
  > [CAHCD-mp-park-query-2021_10_07.csv](https://github.com/aureliamc/up206a-project-mobile_homies/files/7309835/CAHCD-mp-park-query-2021_10_07.csv)
  * Our main dataset includes the location of mobile home parks in the Los Angeles County and acquired digitally through the [California Department of Housing and Community Development](https://casas.hcd.ca.gov/casas/cmirMp/onlineQuery) website. This dataset includes addresses for each MHP, along with the amount of mobile homes and reacreational vehicles (rv) per park. This data does not include coordinates, meaning that geocoding will be necessary in order to use it for this project.

  * Our second dataset includes demographic data of Los Angeles County by Census Tract. We will be using this data to analyze the following variables: total population, sex, age, and race & ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino (of any race),  Not Hispanic or Latino, White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, Two or more races). This data is from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-2019 5-year data profile, and was acuired electronically through the [Census ACS website](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2019/). 
- ### *Scope of Work:*
  - Our goal is to create a spatial analysis and help uplift the living conditions of mobile home and rv residents in County through maps. Our project will tell this story though a series of maps that depict housing, social, economic, and demographic data. In addition, we'd like to explore the historical context of communities with highest MHP concentrations to better understand how structural forces could have influenced exisitng conditions. 
- ### *Objectives: The "Why?"*
  - Where one lives often determines the opportunities that are available and one's quality of life, such as basic needs resources, proximity to jobs, social determinants of health, quality of education, and general safety. As low-income and working-class communities continue to be displaced, the need to assess all affordable housing options throughout the County becomes an increasingly pressing matter. Mobile homes present an additional affordable housing option. Mobile homes are a housing alternative often overlooked in planning. Our goal is to create a visual representation of where these homes exist in the County, and comprise a spatial analysis to better understand barriers, but also how these communities have succeeded to maintain livable habitats for county residents; both of which can help guide future planning practices for MHP residents. By analyzing their location and their proximity to transit, we hope to touch upon the historical factors
