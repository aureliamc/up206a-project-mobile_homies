# Mobile Homies Project Proposal 
- ### *Who:* Paola Tirado EscareÃ±o and Aurelia Mora
- ### *What:* How do Mobile Home Park (MHP) locations vary throughout LA County and what is the access to resources and opportunities within these communities? What might the difference be between MHPs that have closed and those that remain open? Are there differences in the zoning, income, and racial demographics?
  - By focusing on the location of mobile home parks throughout Los Angeles County, we seek to identify how their location is an issue of equity by analyzing the racial and socioeconomic demographics of residents in mobile home parks and their access to resources and opportunities. Because this is such a broad issue, to narrow down our scope, we will be analyzing the differences between mobile home parks that have closed and those that have remained open. We seek to identify whether there are significant differences in the racial and economic demographics as well as any differences in the land use zoning of mobile home parks in LA County. 
  - MHPs have often been sold as an affordable housing option for those who have limited resources and opportunities for homeownership. However, our research has revealed that MHPs are not necessarily the affordable option they are presented as. By visualizing the demographics and the level of access that exists within the cities that contain the most MHPs, we seek to argue how mobile homes as an affordable housing option can serve as a pathway to homeownership if existing practices are refined to serve the residents rather than the property owners. 
- ### *Where:* Greater LA County
  - Our project will be analyzing Mobile Home Parks (MHP) at the County level. Considering that there are few MHPs in the City of Los Angeles, working at the County level allows us to have significantly higher observations to analyze. Using this [map](https://images.app.goo.gl/TFHKFsHWULFbxzD26) as a guide, we will be exploring locations in which there are existing public transit lines, to determine proximity and ability to access. We will also be analyzing supporting indicators at the census tract level. By using LA County census tract and neighborhood data, we aim to have a more centralized analysis of demographics, job opportunities, and social characteristics. 
- ### *Data Sources*: 
  > [CAHCD-mp-park-query-2021_10_07.csv](https://github.com/aureliamc/up206a-project-mobile_homies/files/7309835/CAHCD-mp-park-query-2021_10_07.csv)
  * Our main dataset includes the location of mobile home parks in the Los Angeles County and acquired digitally through the [California Department of Housing and Community Development](https://casas.hcd.ca.gov/casas/cmirMp/onlineQuery) website. This dataset includes addresses for each MHP, along with the amount of mobile homes and reacreational vehicles (rv) per park. This data does not include coordinates, meaning that geocoding will be necessary in order to use it for this project.  
  >[ACS Demographics.zip](https://github.com/aureliamc/up206a-project-mobile_homies/files/7309857/ACS.Demographics.zip)
  * Our second dataset includes demographic data of Los Angeles County by Census Tract. We will be using this data to analyze the following variables: total population, sex, age, and race & ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino (of any race),  Not Hispanic or Latino, White alone, Black or African American alone, American Indian and Alaska Native alone, Asian alone, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, Some other race alone, Two or more races). This data is from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-2019 5-year data profile, and was acuired electronically through the [Census ACS website](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2019/). 
  
  >[TCAC/HCD Opportunity Area Maps](https://github.com/aureliamc/up206a-project-mobile_homies/blob/main/GroupAssignments/data/final_2021_public.shp.zip)
  * This is a new data set that we have found through the Othering and Belonging Institute at UC Berkeley. This data, compiled by the California Fair Housing Task Force identifies and visualizes place-based characteristics linked to critical life outcomes, such as educational attainment, earnings from employment, and economic
mobility.We believe the data from this file will provide greater context to the the existing conditions in cities where MHPs are located and the access to opportunity that exists for residents in these areas. 
- ### *Scope of Work:*
  - Our goal is to create a spatial analysis and help uplift the living conditions of mobile home and rv residents in County through maps. Our project will tell this story though a series of maps that depict housing, social, economic, and demographic data. In addition, we'd like to explore the historical context of communities with highest MHP concentrations to better understand how structural forces could have influenced existing conditions. Additionally, we seek to identify  the role of zoning in determining where MHPs are built or are closed down, and how this may contribute to continued displacement and limited access to opportunity for residents of MHPs. 
- ### *Objectives: The "Why?"*
  - Where one lives often determines the opportunities that are available and one's quality of life, such as basic needs resources, proximity to jobs, social determinants of health, quality of education, and general safety. As low-income and working-class communities continue to be displaced, the need to assess all affordable housing options throughout the County becomes an increasingly pressing matter. Mobile homes present an additional affordable housing option. Mobile homes are a housing alternative often overlooked in planning. Our goal is to create a visual representation of where these homes exist in the County, and comprise a spatial analysis to better understand barriers, but also how these communities have succeeded to maintain livable habitats for county residents; both of which can help guide future planning practices for MHP residents.
