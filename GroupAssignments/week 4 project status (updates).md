# Week 4 - Mini Group Assignment, Project Updates 
### Paola Tirado and Aurelia Mora 
## **Proposal**
  -[Mobile Homies: A Spatial Analysis of Mobile Home Parks in Los Angeles County](https://github.com/aureliamc/up206a-project-mobile_homies/blob/main/GroupAssignments/readme.md)
## **Roles**
  - Paola: geocoding Mobile Home park data
  - Aurelia: compiling qualatative data
## **Status/ Data Update**
  - We have identified a data file with mobile home park. The data only uncldues addresses so it is likely that we will need to geocode it in order to have coordinates. 
  - We also have race/ethnicity and income data which focuses on qualitative factors
  - *What we need:*
    -  Zoning data: this will help us understand the land uses surronding mobile home parks. We will problably retrive data from [Zimas](http://zimas.lacity.org/)
    -  Employment data: this will help us undestand what or if jobs are nearby. Data will probably be retrieved from [Census ACS](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2019/)
  
## **Concerns**
   - Narrow down our research question. What aspects of access to opportunities do we want to focus on? Maybe mobile home parks and accessibility to jobs?
   - Narrowing down our question will help us centralize the location of our analysis.
